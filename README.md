<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
### This challenge was very special one for me, I thought of why not make it my own portfolio. So, I did  my best to make it look great. To make it interactive I added some extra features including

- Layout change
- Theme change (light / dark)

To make it happen, I used some useful libraries which must be mentioned

- Framer motion (For animation)
- React typed (For animated writing like name)
- rsuitejs 

I have named it as version 1, as I am planning on making some more features to add.
